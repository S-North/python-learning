# find all numbers between 2000 and 3200, divisible by 7 but NOT multiple of 5
# solution should be comma separated on a single line



# compute the factorial of a given number, result printed in csv single line
# factorial is the integer product of a number and all the numbers below it
# e.g. 4! is 4 * 3 * 2 * 1


# given integral number n, create a dictionary with key n, and value is the square of n
# integral is a number assigned to a function


# create a list from input of CS values, then convert the list into tuples
